Include this template into the head to use basic footable responsive design.

To include sorting and/or filtering abilities with the footable, pass to the
template in the include statement the additional context variables
"include_sort" and/or "include_filter" set to True, respectively. The default is
to not include sorting or filtering, as these require additional JS files.

To make a table act as a footable, simply add the "footable" class to any
table and include this template. See http://fooplugins.com/footable-demos/ for
further documentation on footable usage.
